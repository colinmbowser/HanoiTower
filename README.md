# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}


{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I saw the tower of hanoi in a movie and thought it would be fun to create a program that could solve it. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I wrote this code in visual studio code and used C++ with iostream, stack, thread and chrono libraries included to make this program.

# Future Work

* Optimize the code.
* Increase the amount of rings in the tower and find the optimal way to solve.
